The following code has been made for an Arduino board. Use the "NewPing" library to measure the distance of 5 HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensors. 4 sensors to measure lateral distances and one to measure height. If the lower sensor measures more than 1.5 meters, the control begins to act. If any of the side sensors measure a distance less than 1.5 meters, it sends a MAVLINK command from RCOverride, which overwrites the inputs received by the Pixhawk from the Operator.
